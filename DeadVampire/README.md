# Ravi Kumawat
I have no special talent, I'm just passionately curious. I believe in this. I basically stepped into this field when I used to compile custom forks of AOSP but gradually, curiosity got the better of me and I dived right into C/C++.C++ will always be my preferred language and the one I am most comfortable to work with but no surprise I'm here right now because in this field, you can't limit yourself to your comfort zone and personal preferences, you gotta explore new things and move forward. And so I started learning python, mainly for Data Science and AI applications, and it's going great as of now.
 
I'm a 1st year B.Tech CSE student. I'm currently following Andrew Ng's ML course on coursera and improving my grasp on Data Structures and Algorithms.

As my new year's resolution, I commit to take **#100DaysOfCode** challenge as a serious check in for doing something productive everyday even if it's for at least an hour, and keep strong dedication towards it.

## Happy Coding!
