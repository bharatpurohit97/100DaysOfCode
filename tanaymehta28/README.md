# Who am I?
Halo! I am Tanay Mehta, a freshman studying in JECRC University. I have a strong passion for Deep Learning, Statistical Modelling, Reinforcement Learning and Computational Neuroscience. I am also 'good-enough' at MEAN Stack, Little-bit of Back-end Web Development and some Basic Web Development here and there. My plans for upcoming 100 days is to work slowly but surely on a Mathematics and Statistical Modelling Library that I am going to build in Python from scratch (P.S: My interpretation of Scratch means NO EXTERNAL LIBRARY, not even numpy).
So, let's hope, we can finish our projects before 100 Days End!
Happy Hacking!

### Day 1

+Added
1. "matrix-generation-and-operations.py"
Here, I have defined 1D and 2D Matrix generation (both zero-matrix and random-matrix).
Also, I have added a class of operators called "MatrixOps" which currently has only one function, 'transpose(array)'; which as the name suggests, transposes the matrix passed as a parameter. Preferably a matrix generated from the above functions for Matrix Generation.

/\Plans: To add Tensor generation and Tensors of more than 3 ranks (preferable upto 8 dimensions would work, unless you are a high-energy physicist at fermilab!(pun there.))

### Day 2
+Added
1. A Linear regression model in Python (Numpy) is added. It does multivariate Linear Regression on Boston House Pricing Dataset. It is still under work, but most of it works just fine. It is implemented in Python by only using Two External Libraries, i.e; Numpy and Pandas.

/\Plans: To make it more memory efficient and decrease it's time complexity.
